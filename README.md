# KMeans
Machine Learning using KMeans clustering


Purpose: 
In this assignment, you have to perform clustering tasks on the given dataset. Our objective is to categorize the candidates into two categories with the hope that it may be able to categorize the two types of candidates and put them into the different clusters. As we have the ground truth of the data, we can also try evaluate whether it was able to categorize them or not. However, note that in general, you may not have the ground truth to evaluate a cluster like this.
